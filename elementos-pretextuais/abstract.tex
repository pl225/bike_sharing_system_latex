Bicycle sharing systems are becoming more popular worldwide, given the benefits of implementing them in large urban centers, such as reducing traffic congestion and improving people's quality of life. In this way, it is useful to study the problems associated with such systems, such as the issue of bicycle distribution by stations and also the best way to do this. Alternatives will be studied and suggested in this document in order to provide acceptable results that help in the implementation of such systems. These alternatives will be based on mathematical models and meta-heuristics of combinatorial optimization.
